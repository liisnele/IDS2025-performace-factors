# Project E8: KAGGLE - TWO PATHS TO PREDICTING SUCCESS
## Building and comparing regression and classification models to identify key factors influencing student academic performance.

**Dataset 1 (641.95 kB):** Kaggle dataset which contains data on 6607 students and the factors influencing their academic performance such as hours spent studying, parental involvement, motivation level, internet access and others. [1] 

**Goal 1:** Build a regression model to predict the final student grade based on the factors influencing the student.

**Goal 2:** Define a threshold to convert the target into a binary classification problem to find out high-achiever and low-achievers. Then train classification models to predict which students will be high or low-achievers. Visualizing the differences between the groups.

**Goal 3:** Comparing the performance and interpretability of regression models and classification models. The comparison will highlight which method provides more actionable insights for identifying students at risk of low performance.
